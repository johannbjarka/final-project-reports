\section{Expected outcome}\label{sec:expected_outcome}

Two outcomes were expected by the end of this project.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{The release of the finished game client, as it was in its second design iteration, on the live \emph{EVE Online} testing server \emph{Singularity}. This involved implementing most of the main features and design, as the game was barely in a playable state when the project started.}
	\item{The release of a website where users can access general information about \emph{Project Discovery}, view a page where they could learn more about how to classify images correctly, and view statistics on how many images the \emph{EVE} community has classified. }
\end{enumerate}

Before we could start working towards those expectations we needed to work on fixing existing flaws within the game client that had come up just before the project began. Flaws such as authentication issues to the MMOS API, images not being uploaded to the Amazon clouds and optimization of the in-game client. We started fixing those errors right away so feature implementation could start as soon as possible.
