This report describes our final project, entitled ``Project Discovery''. This
project was conducted fall 2015 at Reykjavik University as a B.Sc project at
the School of Computer Science. This project was done in collaboration with CCP
Games, Cadia and MMOS.

``Project Discovery'' is a game with a purpose (GWAP) within the EVE-Online
Universe. Players are tasked with classifying images of immunofluorescently
stained cells. In reward players are given in-game money, experience points and
other rewards.
