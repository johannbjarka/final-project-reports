\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This report describes our final project, entitled ``Project Discovery''. This
project was conducted fall 2015 at Reykjavik University as a B.Sc project at
the School of Computer Science. This project was done in collaboration with CCP
Games, CADIA and MMOS.

``Project Discovery'' is a game with a purpose (GWAP) within the EVE-Online
Universe. Players are tasked with classifying images of immunofluorescently
stained cells. In reward players are given in-game money, experience points and
other rewards.

This report is structured as follows. In section~\ref{sec:ccp} we discuss background 
for the project, CCP and how CCP fits into the project. In section~\ref{sec:gwap} we talk about GWAP's and how MMOS is involved. In section~\ref{sec:project_discovery} we go into detail about the game itself and finally in section~\ref{sec:expected_outcome} we discuss the expected outcome of the project.
