\section{Project Discovery}\label{sec:project_discovery}
In this section we discuss the status of the game as it was at the beginning of the project, and outline the architecture of the game  MMOS API.
\subsection{Beginning status of the game}
When the project began, the newest user interface design had been decided, and the game had around half of that design already implemented. Some features had already been implemented, such as players being able to receive images, selecting their appropiate categories and submitting their classifications. A simple rewarding system was already in place, rewarding players with in game currency (ISK), experience points (XP) and loyalty points (LP). A rudamentary tutorial phase was already in place, but needed reforming.\\
