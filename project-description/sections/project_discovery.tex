\section{Project Discovery}\label{sec:project_discovery}
In this section we discuss the status of the game as it was at the beginning of the project.

When the project began, the newest user interface design had been decided, and the game had around half of that design already implemented. The design can be seen on figure \ref{fig:PD}.

The game already had a few features implemented, such as players being able to receive images, selecting their appropriate categories and submitting their classifications. A simple rewarding system was also already in place, rewarding players with in game currency (ISK), experience points (XP) and loyalty points (LP) when players submitted a solution. The reward was based on their score for the image they just classified, but since those images were 'training images', we knew the solution and could grade the player on that. However, that needed to be changed later on because when the client got an image that we did not know the solution for, no reward was given. Finally, a rudimentary tutorial phase was implemented, but it was too small and needed to be expanded to improve new player experience.
