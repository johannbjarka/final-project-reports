\section{Project Discovery}\label{sec:project_discovery}
In this section we discuss the status of the game as it was at the beginning of the project, and outline the game itself.\\

When the project began, the newest user interface design had been decided, and the game had around half of that design already implemented. See figure \ref{fig:PD}.

\end{figure}

As is seen on \ref{fig:PD}, some features had already been implemented. Features such as players being able to receive images, selecting their appropriate categories and submitting their classifications. A simple rewarding system was already in place, rewarding players with in game currency (ISK), experience points (XP) and loyalty points (LP). A rudamentary tutorial phase was implemented, but too small and needed to be expanded to improve new player experience.\\
