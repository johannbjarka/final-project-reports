\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This report illustrates the schedule and overall progress of our BSc final project named \emph{Project Discovery}. In section \ref{sec:process}, we explain our work process, how we scheduled the hours available to us and how the hours were actually spent. In section \ref{sec:timetracking}, we illustrate the total time spent on this project, and how it was divided along the project's duration. In section \ref{sec:riskanalysis}, we illustrate our risk analysis plan and discuss its benefits for this project. In section \ref{sec:burndown} we display the burndown chart for the entire project and discuss our expected and actual velocity. In section \ref{sec:sprints}, we illustrate and explain each sprint in detail, by going over each sprint's backlog and also each sprint's burndown chart, as well sprint retrospectives. And finally, in section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we conclude this report and discuss how the schedule worked out for us.
