\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This project was an excellent exercise on how to correctly use the Scrum methodology and how to really benefit from using it. There were some mistakes in the beginning, but we as a team pulled it together and felt accomplished and organized as the project grew longer. It was great visually representing the work progress, in order to physically see if the project was doing well or not during that sprint. When we saw that any particular sprint did not go well, we worked to improve our process and adapt to the project's needs. The Scrum methodology was a great choice for this team and this project, partly because CCP Games uses that process, and partly because of the documentation that Scrum gives. In the end we feel we have a better grasp of organizing and managing the flow of a large development project within a large game developer like CCP Games.
