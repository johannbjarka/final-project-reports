\section{Risk Analysis}\label{sec:riskanalysis}

In figure \ref{fig:risk}, we see the risk analysis we performed. It represented a list of possible risks that we believed could have influenced the project negatively. 

We created this list to help us better identify and realize realistic risks, in order to be better prepared to deal with them if any ever arose. Nothing drastic happened over the course of this project, although there were quite a lot of changes to the API, it was not something that delayed us in a significant way.
