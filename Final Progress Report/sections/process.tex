\section{Process}\label{sec:process}
For this project we utilized the Scrum methodology because it helped us document in detail the work, organize the project, its progress and ourselves. The appointed Scrum Master was Jóhann, the Product Owner and Project Manager was Pétur Örn Þórarinsson from CCP. The project consisted of eight, two week long sprints, with the work load divided in such a way so that the team could direct enough attention towards other courses, as well as work on the project.

Daily Scrum meetings were held at CCP headquarters every work day. During the three week term they took place at 11:30 AM, but they were held at various times of the day during the 12 week term, as the team wasn't always present throughout the day. Weekly meeting were held with Attila Szantner from MMOS and Pétur Örn Þórarinsson, where we went over the progress of the week and discussed the problems for the next week. We chose Scrum because it gave us good documentation on the team's progress and it gave us an indication of what we could achieve according to our velocity. With each iteration we could track what was going well and what needed improving. Scrum gave us the platform to review and improve on our process during each iteration.
