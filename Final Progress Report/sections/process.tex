\section{Process}\label{sec:process}
For this project we utilized the Scrum methodology to help us document and organize the project and its progress. The appointed Scrum Master was Jóhann, the Product Owner that represented the team was Hjalti and the Product Owner on behalf of CCP was Pétur Örn Þórarinsson who was also our Project Manager. Since the team only consisted of two people, the Scrum Master and Product Owner made up the the whole team. The project consisted of eight, two week long sprints, with the work divided so that the team could direct enough attention towards other courses, as well as work on the project.

Daily Scrum meetings were held at CCP headquarters every work day. During the three week term they took place at 11:30 AM, but they were held at various times of the day during the 12 week term, as the team wasn't always present throughout the day. We chose Scrum because it gave us good documentation on the team's progress and it gave us an indication of what we could achieve according to our velocity. With each iteration we could track what was going well and what needed improving. Scrum gave us the platform to review and improve on our process during each iteration.
