\section{Future Work}\label{sec:futurework}
Once the game has been released on the Singularity test server we expect hundreds and optimistically thousands of players to experience the feature there. There will hopefully be a lot of data and feedback from players for whoever continues with the project. There were also some features planned that we wanted to implement but didn't have time to do before the Singularity release, we expect those features to be worked on next. Those include leaderboards, daily challenges and a more interactive tutorial. Once those features have been implemented and once the feedback from players has been responded to, we are hopeful that the game will be launched on Tranquility, EVE Online's main server cluster. 

The subcellular protein atlas, the current project from the Human Protein Atlas that Project Discovery is being utilized for, has a finite number of images. Therefore analysis of those images will at some point conclude, which could actually happen pretty early in the lifespan of the game if EVE Online players embrace the feature. Once that point is reached there is the possibility to adapt Project Discovery to work with other citizen science projects. The Human Protein Atlas for an example has other atlases that could potentially be the focus of Project Discovery in the future. MMOS designed their API with this in mind, they expect the subcellular atlas to be the first of many scientific projects that Project Discovery assists. The game client has also been structured with regard to this possibility. To use the client for another project would of course need certain customization for that project so it's not something that is quick and easy to do, but it is definitely possible.
