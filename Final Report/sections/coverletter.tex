``The previous half year we had Hjalti Leifsson and Jóhann Örn Bjarkason on the team of Project Discovery. The project posed several challenges to the students from the utilisation of diverse technologies to the project team being in different geographical locations (Iceland, Sweden, Switzerland, USA). Hjalti and Jóhann made an excellent job of overcoming obstacles and implementing the in-game citizen science client - taking it from a prototype phase all the way to production quality. Their motivation was unquestionable and they were also very good team players.''

``Hjalti and Jóhann have both proven to be highly intelligent, self-motivated and dedicated in their work towards making Project Discovery a reality. They have brought this feature to a high standard of quality that even a seasoned developer at CCP could be proud of. As a part of their project, they prepared a demo build that CCP was able to put into the hands of our players at an EVE player gathering in Vegas, and the reception was spectacular. They really made this project their own and it’s been a privilege to be on this mission with them.''
