``The previous half year we had Hjalti Leifsson and Jóhann Örn Bjarkason on the team of Project Discovery. The project posed several challenges to the students from the utilisation of diverse technologies to the project team being in different geographical locations (Iceland, Sweden, Switzerland, USA). Hjalti and Jóhann made an excellent job of overcoming obstacles and implementing the in-game citizen science client - taking it from a prototype phase all the way to production quality. Their motivation was unquestionable and they were also very good team players.''
