\section{Work schedule and flow}\label{sec:workscheduleandflow}

In this section we deviate from talking about citizen science and Project Discovery and go over the work schedule and flow we followed during the project. We will discuss the methodology we decided to use to aid us during the project and how that influenced the project. We will go over the work schedule we put together and how we managed to follow that schedule. We will also show the burndown chart for the project as a whole and discuss all of the sprints that we finished while working on the project.

CCP Games graciously allowed us access to two work stations within their headquarters in Reykjavík, and placed us in an EVE development team with senior EVE developers who were available to us when we needed help with the project. They allowed us full access to the headquarters, along with the cafeteria with complementary lunch, which allowed us to stay in house and focus on the development of \emph{Project Discovery}.

\subsection{Methodology}
	For this project we utilized the Scrum methodology to help us document and organize the project and its progress. The appointed Scrum Master was Jóhann and the Product Owner was Hjalti. Pétur Örn Þórarinsson, a lead game designer at CCP, served as our Project Manager. Since the team only consisted of two people, the Scrum Master and Product Owner made up the the whole team. The project consisted of seven, two week long sprints, with the work divided so that the team could direct enough attention towards other courses, as well as work on the project.

	Daily Scrum meetings were held at CCP headquarters every work day. During the three week term they took place at 11:30 AM, but they were held at various times of the day during the 12 week term, as the team wasn't always present throughout the day. We chose Scrum because it gave us good documentation on the team's progress and it gave us an indication of what we could achieve according to our velocity. With each iteration we could track what was going well and what needed improving. Scrum gave us the platform to review and improve on our process during each iteration.

\subsection{Initial plan}
	\subsubsection{Initial schedule}
		When we started the project, we estimated how much time we could afford to spend on the project, taking into account the workload from other courses. We ended up estimating that we had a total team capacity of 654 hours to spend during the entire project. A breakdown of how we scheduled those hours can be seen in table \ref{table:hours}. Work on the project was essentially split into two phases, the first one being the 12 week semester, from the 17th of August to November the 11th, in which other courses affected work on the project. The second one being the three week semester, from the 26th of November to December the 16th, where we could focus all our attention on the project.

	\subsubsection{Initial stories}
		At the beginning of the project we, in collaboration with our project manager, populated a backlog of stories we felt we needed to implement. The backlog included 35 A stories, 9 B stories and 6 C stories, totaling 50 stories. Our goal was to at least finish all the A stories, any B or C stories would be a bonus. The A stories totaled 458 story points, the B stories totaled 106 story points and the C stories totaled 89 story points. Altogether the stories came to a total of 653 story points.

	\subsubsection{Actual stories}
		The stories we ended up implementing changed quite a lot from what we had planned. A lot of stories got added a during the project and a few got dropped because of changes to the project's focus. The main reason for this deviation from the plan was the user test we performed, it spawned a lot of new ideas and features that we hadn't even thought of before. At the end of the project we had 50 A stories, totaling 570 story points, 18 B stories with 251 story points and 5 C stories that totaled 64 story points. We decided to focus on finishing all the A stories, which we managed to do. Finishing those 570 story points gave us a velocity of 81.4 story points per sprint. The remaining B and C stories will hopefully be implemented in the near future, which we discuss in greater detail in section \ref{sec:futurework}.
