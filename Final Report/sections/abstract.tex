\begin{abstract}
We are two students from Reykjavik University, and this project was our final project for the fall semester of 2015. The work we did for this project was a continuation of what two previous students had done as their final project for the spring semester of 2015, where they developed a web prototype and after showcasing it at EVE Fanfest 2015, started integrating it into the EVE Online client.
