In this report we discuss the problems various scientific projects are struggling with, and explain how we can work towards solving them by utilizing ordinary people playing video games. The goal of the project was to design and develop such a game where people could help real world scientific problems in an entertaining way.

We are two students from Reykjavik University, this project served as our BSc final project in computer science for the fall semester of 2015, and the work we did for this project was a continuation of what two previous students had done as their final project for the spring semester of 2015.
