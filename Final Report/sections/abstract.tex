Classification of scientific data can be hard -- even for computers. In recent years methods have been developed which allow individuals, with minimal knowledge, to help scientists classify and tag such data while playing video games either consciously or unconsciously. 

In this report we introduce a modified version of a video game, within the \emph{EVE Online} client, entitled \emph{Project Discovery}, where the goal is to classify images of cells by observing protein patterns.

This work was part of a B.Sc final project in the School of Computer Science at Reykjavik University, fall 2015.
