\section{Project Discovery}\label{sec:projectdiscovery}

	In this section we discuss the game itself. We explain how it communicates with MMOS' API, the code architecture of the game client and how it fits into the EVE Online client. We also go over how the gameplay works and lastly consider the website we built to go along with the game's launch.

\subsection{Network Communications}
	The Project Discovery client utilizes a connection with two different parts, the EVE server, and the MMOS RESTful API, which uses the Amazon CloudFront CDN and an Elastic Beanstalk container.

	When a player opens up the client, it automatically contacts the EVE server, which connects to the MMOS API and asks for a new task for the player. The MMOS API then decides the new task and fetches it from the Elastic Beanstalk container, and sends it to the EVE server, which finally sends it to the EVE client. The task object includes a security pass that the client needs to access the URLs for each image that he needs for the task. Each time the client needs an image for that task, it contacts the EVE server, which contacts the MMOS API with the security pass, if that pass is still active, the Amazon CloudFront CDN returns a signed URL that leads to that image, the image itself is only accessible for a few seconds, as a security feature, so the client needs to cache the image in case the player needs to access it again.

	The MMOS API authentication uses a HMAC-SHA256 method, based on Amazon authentication methods. The server has an API key and secret, which are changed at regular intervals. The API key and secret are used to generate a signing key, this adds an additional layer of security, since every message is hashed with different values.

\subsection{Gameplay}
	The objective of the game is classify subcellular images correctly. A typical gameplay flow is as follows: The player opens up Project Discovery, an image is loaded and the player studies the image. To help the player do so we implemented a magnification function which allows the player to zoom in on the image by hovering over it with his mouse, this gives the player the full resolution of the image and enables him to examine its details very effectively.

	  \caption{\label{fig:zoom}An image with its original resolution and a zoomed in version.}
	\end{figure} 

	\subsubsection{Tutorial}
		When a player opens up Project Discovery for the first time he must start by going through a tutorial phase. We created the tutorial from scratch with the exception of some tooltip functionality which was already in place, although we refined it. The purpose of the tutorial phase is to allow the player to familiarize himself with the controls and the user interface of the game as well as teaching him the basics of analyzing subcellular images. To achieve this we first introduce the player to the controls by using tooltips which explain the functionality of each control element, one at a time, while also allowing the player to interact with the controls.

		  \centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.53]{tooltip.png}}
		  \caption{\label{fig:tooltip}The tooltip which explains the cytoplasm category, making it the only active part of interface.}
		\end{figure}

		Once the player has gone through the tooltips he gets his first image to analyze, this image is the first stage of seven in the tutorial. Each stage contains one image hand picked by scientists at the Human Protein Atlas and it presents a gradual increase in difficulty from the previous stage. To ease the player into the game and not overwhelm him with all 27 categories, we limit the number of categories available to choose from, to the correct ones plus a few similar but incorrect categories.

		  \caption{\label{fig:limited}An example of a tutorial stage where the categories are limited to only three nucleus categories.}
		\end{figure}

		When the player submits his classification a results screen is displayed. It shows the correct result by overlaying the categories the player picked with either a green correct or red incorrect texture and giving any categories that are correct but the player missed, a green outline texture indicating a missed category. By giving the player instant feedback on their submission we allow the player to learn from any possible mistakes they make. Players do not have to get the correct results for the seven stages of the tutorial to advance, we believed that could be a source of frustration since it would make the tutorial longer.

	\subsubsection{Training tasks}
		After finishing the tutorial the player receives rewards for doing so and is then moved on to the next phase of the game which we refer to as the training phase. This phase, like the tutorial, consists of seven stages but unlike the tutorial players must get the correct result in each stage to advance to the main part of the game. The stages also increase in difficulty and are in general more difficult than the tutorial images. The

\subsection{The website}
	One of the goals of the project was to launch a Project Discovery website along with the release of the game. The website serves as an information hub for the project. Interested parties can get information about the game, the science behind the game and our partners, MMOS and the Human Protein Atlas. The website also displays videos related to the game and screenshots of the game in action. To build the website we used HTML5, Less and JavaScript. We were provided with a template from web developers within CCP which helped us make the website look professional and consistent with other EVE Online websites.
