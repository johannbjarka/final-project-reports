\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
	In this section we discuss what a game with a purpose is, and why our project falls within that category.
	Next we outline the previous work already committed to the project by previous students.
	We discuss MMOS (Massively Multiplayer Online Science), CCP Games, The Human Protein Atlas, and what they have done for the project. And finally we show how this project helped solve real world problems in the biological sciences.

\subsection{Game with a purpose}
	A game with a purpose is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. Specifically by outsourcing computationally difficult functions to humans in an entertaining way. There have been many GWAP's released over the years, each of them contributing in some way to real world problems such as cancer research to exoplanet discovery.
