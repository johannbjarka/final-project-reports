\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
For the purpose of this test we booked a game design room within CCP for the entire 9th of October. We sent out emails to CCP staff, asking them to take the test, and specifying the time they could arrive.

The test was performed on a computer that remotely connected to our personal work desktop. When a tester arrived, we greeted them, thanked them for coming, and explained the procedure. The procedure was that the tester would sit down and we would observe them from behind. The player would open Project Discovery, finish the tutorial and a handful of other tasks. While playing the tester would verbally express their thoughts, for us to write down. Testers could play for as long as they wanted, given that they continued to think aloud.

After the tester had finished playing we asked them five questions, which are outlined in section \ref{sec:data}, and finally thanked them for their contribution to the project.
