\section{Sample}\label{sec:sample}
For this test we purposely got people only from within CCP to perfom it. The reason for that is that the game was only to be revealed at the EVE Vegas conference so we could not get people outside of CCP to perform the test. This means that the sample was biased, the people who performed the test had an interest in the well being of the project and some even had extensive experience in game development and/or game design. Even though that was the case, we felt that the test was necessary. 

We got five volunteers from CCP, four males and one female between the ages of 25 to 40. The males were a mix of game designers and QA (Quality Assurance) people. The female was a community manager for EVE Online.
