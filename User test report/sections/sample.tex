\section{Sample}\label{sec:sample}
For this test we only got people from within CCP to take part. The reason for that is that the game was not ready to be revealed to the public so we could not get people outside of CCP to perform the test. This means that the sample was biased, the people who performed the test might have had an interest in the well-being of the project as CCP employess and some even had extensive experience in game development or game design. Even with those drawbacks, we felt that the test was necessary. 

We got five volunteers from CCP, four males and one female between the ages of 25 to 40. The people were a mix of game designers, quality assurance people and a community developer.
