\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In conclusion, the user testing went great, we had some great testers and it was very interesting seeing them play Project Discovery. We learned some great things, and are working on fixing them already. We are planning to have fixed all the issues before the release on the Singularity testing server and running another full blown user test shortly before that.
