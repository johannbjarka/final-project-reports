\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
As a team we were advised by our project manager to perform preliminary, in-house user testing before the Project Discovery game would be showcased at EVE Vegas, a conference made for EVE Online players and fans. The purpose of this test was to shed light on any obvious errors with the game and especially the fledgling tutorial phase, since people will get to try it themselves at the conference. 

In this report we outline how we performed this user test, what we learned from it, and what we plan to do about the results. In section \ref{sec:sample}, we discuss the people we got to perform this test. In section \ref{sec:implementation}, we talk about where the test was performed and it's implementation. In section \ref{sec:data}, we outline the data retreived from this test. And finally, in section \ref{sec:results}, we discuss what we learned from this test, and what we are going to do about those results.
