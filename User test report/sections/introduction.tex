\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
As a team we were advised by our project manager to perform preliminary, in-house user tests before the Project Discovery game would be showcased at EVE Vegas, a conference for EVE Online players and fans. The purpose of this test was to shed light on any obvious errors with the game, especially the tutorial phase which was at an early stage.

In this report we outline how we performed the user test, what we learned from it, and what we plan to do about the results. In section \ref{sec:sample}, we discuss the people we got to perform this test. In section \ref{sec:implementation}, we talk about where the test was performed and it's implementation. In section \ref{sec:data}, we outline the data retrieved from this test. And finally, in section \ref{sec:results}, we discuss what we learned from the test, and what we intend to do with the results we gathered.
