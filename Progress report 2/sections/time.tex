\section{Time Tracking Breakdown }\label{sec:time}

Below are summaries of the time we have spent on the project so far. A total for the team can be seen in \ref{fig:team}. The team has contributed over 309 hours so far to the project in eight weeks, if we keep that contribution up throughout the 12 week term we will have turned in around 425 hours which is quite a bit more than the minimum we planned for that period, which was 354 hours.
