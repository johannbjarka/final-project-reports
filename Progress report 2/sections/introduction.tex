\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

In this report we discuss the progress of our final project, \emph{Project Discovery}. In section~\ref{sec:time} we list the hours we have spent so far on the project in total and for each of us. In section~\ref{sec:burndown} we show the status of the burndown chart at this point, after four sprints have been completed. In section~\ref{sec:backlog} we go over the sprint backlogs of the sprints we've done so far and show the burndown charts for each sprint we have completed. Lastly in section~\ref{sec:retrospectives} we summarize our sprint planning and retrospective meetings.
