\section{Work Schedule}\label{schedule}
Our work schedule is split into two different phases. The first is during the 12 week semester from the 17th of August to November the 11th. Our schedule during that period is influenced by classes and course work in other courses. During the 3 week semester from the 26th of November to December the 16th this project is our only concern so we intend to dedicate most of our time to it. 

\subsection{Schedule for the 12 week semester}
  This table gives a detailed view of our scheduled hours to work on the project during the 12 week term. This is the minimum amount of hours we pledge to dedicate to the project during the term. The difference in hours spent on the project for team members during this phase can be explained by a more favorable schedule in other courses for Jóhann.
