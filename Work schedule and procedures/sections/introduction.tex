\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
In this report we discuss how the work on the final project called "Project Discovery", done in collaboration with CCP, MMOS and CADIA, took place. We show the work schedule that we followed and describe the tools we used for the project's implementation. We also discuss which software development methodology we adhered to, and the facilities we had at our disposal for the duration of the project. 

This report also worked as a contract for the team, both members agreed to the contents of this report, and agreed to follow the requirements within.
