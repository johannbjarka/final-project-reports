\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}
For this project we will be utilizing the Scrum methodology to help us document and organize the project and its progress. The appointed Scrum Master is Jóhann, the Product Owner that represents the team is Hjalti and the product owner on behalf of CCP will be Pétur Örn Þórarinsson who will also be our Project Manager. Since the team only consists of two people, the Scrum Master and Product Owner are the whole team. The project will consist of eight, two week long sprints, with the work divided so that the team can direct enough attention at their school studies and tests, as well as work on the project.

Daily Scrum meetings will be held at CCP headquarters every day, at a time the team sees fit. We chose Scrum because it, if followed correctly, gives us good documentation on the team's progress and should give us an indication of what we can achieve according to our velocity. With each iteration we can track what is going well and what needs improving. Scrum gives us the platform to review and improve on our process during each iteration.
