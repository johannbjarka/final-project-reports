\section{Sprint Planning and Retrospectives}\label{sec:retrospectives}

\subsection{Sprint 1}
The theme of the sprint was documentation, since a lot of reports were due during this sprint. The theme also included getting introduced to the project and getting to know the tools required.


Some of the things that went well were that we finished every story on the sprint backlog, getting to know the project went well since Þór Adam Rúnarsson, a previous project member, provided good hand-off information to us.


The things that did not go so well were that we underestimated the size of most of the stories, specifically the ones related to documentation. These stories should have been rated higher, since we ended up spending a lot of time on them. We also wasted too much time on technical difficulties, such as getting access to the version control system. 

\subsection{Sprint 2}
The theme of the sprint was fixing errors, optimization and improving documentation.

The things that went well so far in this sprint were that we managed to fix all errors and managed to optimize the game. 

Some of the things that did not go so well were that we had to spend a lot of time improving our documentation, so that we have not yet managed to finish the big stories of the sprint.
